[00:10.73]Looking at it now
[00:13.01]
[00:14.89]It all seems so simple
[00:17.44]
[00:20.47]We were lying on your couch
[00:23.45]
[00:25.79]I remember
[00:27.25]
[00:30.68]You took a Polaroid of us
[00:33.55]
[00:36.10]Then discovered
[00:37.87]
[00:40.99]The rest of the world
[00:42.75]Was black and white
[00:44.60]
[00:46.23]But we were in screaming color
[00:49.42]
[00:51.15]And I remember thinking
[00:52.20]
[00:52.79]Are we out of the woods yet 
[00:54.09]Are we out of the woods yet 
[00:55.28]Are we out of the woods yet 
[00:56.55]Are we out of the woods 
[00:58.07]Are we in the clear yet 
[00:59.23]Are we in the clear yet 
[01:00.55]Are we in the clear yet 
[01:01.85]In the clear yet good 
[01:03.19]Are we out of the woods yet 
[01:04.48]Are we out of the woods yet 
[01:05.85]Are we out of the woods yet 
[01:07.03]Are we out of the woods 
[01:08.47]Are we in the clear yet 
[01:09.73]Are we in the clear yet 
[01:11.04]Are we in the clear yet 
[01:12.47]In the clear yet good 
[01:14.16]
[01:16.42]Are we out of the woods 
[01:18.81]Looking at it now
[01:20.86]
[01:23.06]Last December 
[01:24.78]
[01:28.30]We were built to fall apart
[01:31.53]
[01:33.14]Then fall back together
[01:35.28]
[01:38.52]Your necklace hanging from my neck
[01:41.29]The night we couldn't quite forget
[01:43.89]When we decided
[01:45.93]
[01:46.77]We decided
[01:48.39]
[01:48.95]To move the furniture
[01:50.62]So we could dance
[01:52.19]Baby like we stood a chance
[01:54.15]Two paper airplanes flying flying
[01:58.08]Flying
[01:58.86]And I remember thinking
[02:00.01]
[02:00.52]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:01.92]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:03.22]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:04.48]Are we out of the woods 
[02:05.88]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:07.06]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:08.37]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:09.60]In the clear yet good 
[02:11.17]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:12.40]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:13.67]Are we out of the woods yet 
[02:14.90]Are we out of the woods 
[02:16.35]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:17.56]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:18.76]Are we in the clear yet 
[02:20.16]In the clear yet good 
[02:21.54]
[02:24.26]Are we out of the woods 
[02:25.99]
[02:27.09]Remember when you hit
[02:28.41]The brakes too soon
[02:29.64]Twenty stitches in a hospital room
[02:32.15]When you started crying
[02:33.24]Baby I did too
[02:34.55]But when the sun came up
[02:35.74]I was looking at you
[02:37.41]Remember
[02:37.92]When we couldn't take the heat
[02:40.05]I walked out 
[02:40.82]I said "I'm setting you free"
[02:42.35]But the monsters
[02:43.12]Turned out to be just trees
[02:44.96]When the sun came up
[02:46.17]You were looking at me 
[02:48.28]
[02:51.58]You were looking at me
[02:53.57]
[02:54.90]Oh
[02:55.58]
[02:56.83]You were looking at me 
[02:58.30]
[03:02.35]I remember 
[03:03.86]
[03:06.38]Oh I remember
