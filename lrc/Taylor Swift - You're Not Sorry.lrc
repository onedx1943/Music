[00:00.40]
[00:14.81]All this time I was wasting 
[00:16.85]Hoping you would come around
[00:19.21]
[00:21.57]I've been giving out chances every time
[00:24.05]And all you do is let me down
[00:26.48]
[00:28.52]And it's taking me this long
[00:30.75]Baby but I figured you out
[00:33.55]
[00:35.57]And you're thinking we'll be fine again 
[00:37.95]But not this time around
[00:40.65]
[00:41.40]You don't have to call anymore
[00:45.31]
[00:46.32]I won't pick up the phone
[00:49.06]This is the last straw
[00:52.78]
[00:53.56]Don't wanna hurt anymore
[00:55.28]
[00:57.03]And you can say that you're sorry
[00:59.40]But I don't believe you baby
[01:00.57]Like I did before
[01:02.73]
[01:03.86]You're not sorry no no ohhh
[01:11.00]
[01:19.41]Looking so innocent 
[01:20.76]I might believe you if I didn't know
[01:23.53]
[01:25.89]Could've loved you all my life
[01:28.01]If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
[01:30.82]
[01:33.01]And you got your share of singers
[01:35.32]And I'm tired of being last to know
[01:38.79]
[01:40.02]And now you're asking me to listen
[01:42.03]Cause it's worked each time before
[01:45.93]But you don't have to call anymore
[01:49.64]
[01:50.75]I won't pick up the phone
[01:53.12]
[01:53.63]This is the last straw
[01:57.12]
[01:58.00]Don't wanna hurt anymore
[01:59.70]
[02:01.54]And you can tell me that you're sorry
[02:03.85]But I don't believe you baby
[02:05.27]Like I did before
[02:07.31]
[02:08.31]You're not sorry no no ohhh
[02:12.90]
[02:15.45]You're not sorry no no ohhh
[02:20.04]
[02:37.55]You had me falling for you honey
[02:39.45]And it never would've gone away no
[02:43.37]
[02:44.50]You used to shine so bright
[02:46.52]But I watched all of it fade
[02:48.83]
[02:49.87]So you don't have to call anymore
[02:54.11]
[02:55.21]I won't pick up the phone
[02:58.03]This is the last straw
[03:01.56]
[03:02.37]There's nothing left to beg for
[03:05.03]
[03:06.15]And you can tell me that you're sorry
[03:07.92]But I don't believe you baby
[03:09.59]Like I did before
[03:11.92]
[03:12.79]You're not sorry no no ohhh
[03:17.22]
[03:19.87]You're not sorry no no ohhh
[03:24.33]
[03:27.73]Na na na na na na na na
[03:34.20]Na na na na na na whoa
