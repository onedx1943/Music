[00:11.91]You have a way of coming
[00:16.63]Easily to me
[00:19.42]
[00:22.70]And when you take
[00:25.34]You take the very best of me
[00:30.42]
[00:32.54]So I start a fight
[00:35.10]Cause I need to feel something
[00:38.00]And you do what you want
[00:40.10]Cause I'm not what you wanted
[00:44.01]
[00:44.53]Oh what a shame
[00:47.41]What a rainy ending
[00:49.41]Given to a perfect day
[00:52.77]
[00:55.21]So just walk away
[00:58.57]No use defending words
[01:00.67]That you will never say
[01:03.59]
[01:05.60]And now that I'm sitting here
[01:08.40]Thinking it through
[01:10.47]
[01:11.04]I've never been anywhere
[01:13.84]Cold as you
[01:19.27]
[01:28.10]You put up walls
[01:30.82]And paint them
[01:32.89]All a shade of gray
[01:36.17]
[01:39.01]And I stood there loving you
[01:42.81]And washed them all away
[01:47.90]
[01:48.97]And you come away
[01:51.56]With a great little story
[01:54.35]Of a mess of a dreamer
[01:56.49]
[01:57.14]With the nerve to adore you
[01:59.95]
[02:00.93]Oh what a shame
[02:03.75]What a rainy ending
[02:05.58]Given to a perfect day
[02:09.21]
[02:11.43]So just walk away
[02:14.90]No use defending words
[02:16.92]That you will never say
[02:19.97]
[02:22.01]And now that I'm sitting here
[02:24.89]Thinking it through
[02:27.34]I've never been anywhere
[02:30.18]Cold as you
[02:34.00]
[02:44.21]You never did give a damn thing 
[02:48.03]Honey
[02:48.55]But I cried cried for you
[02:53.45]
[02:54.06]And I know you
[02:56.06]Wouldn't have told nobody
[02:59.43]If I died
[03:01.07]Died for you died for you
[03:08.16]
[03:11.95]Oh what a shame
[03:13.98]
[03:14.58]What a rainy ending
[03:16.47]Give to a perfect day
[03:20.77]
[03:22.67]Every smile you fake is so condescending
[03:27.46]Counted all the scars you made
[03:30.69]
[03:32.91]Now that I'm sitting here
[03:35.52]Thinking it through
[03:37.58]
[03:38.20]I've never been anywhere cold as you
